# Screen Reader Accessibility Features

## Focus Management Implementation

### Main Changes Made:

1. **Automatic Focus Setting on Page Changes**
   - Added `focusFirstElementOnPage()` method to `EnBrailleWindow`
   - Automatically sets focus to the first relevant focusable element when navigating between wizard pages
   - Uses a priority system to focus the most important elements first (radio buttons, text inputs, combo boxes, buttons)
   - Falls back to any focusable widget if no priority element is found
   - As last resort, makes labels temporarily focusable for screen reader announcements

2. **Enhanced Page Initialization**
   - Updated `initializePage()` methods in multiple page classes:
     - `EnBrailleWizardPageStart`: Focuses first radio button
     - `EnBrailleSimpleTextPage`: Focuses braille table combo box
     - `EnBrailleDocumentPage`: Focuses document browse button
     - `EnBrailleReformatPage`: Focuses file choose button

3. **Improved Navigation**
   - Override `next()` and `back()` methods to ensure focus is managed during navigation
   - Connected focus management to `currentIdChanged` signal for all page transitions
   - Uses small delays (50ms) to ensure pages are fully rendered before setting focus

4. **Accessibility Properties**
   - Added `accessibleName` and `accessibleDescription` to main wizard window
   - Enhanced individual pages with proper accessible names and descriptions
   - Associated labels with form controls using `setBuddy()` relationships
   - Added keyboard shortcuts (Alt+T, Alt+D, Alt+R) for quick function selection

5. **Enhanced Keyboard Navigation**
   - Enabled `WA_KeyboardFocusChange` attribute for better keyboard handling
   - Added help button shortcut support
   - Proper focus policies set on all interactive elements

## Technical Implementation Details:

### Priority Focus Order:
1. QRadioButton - for selections
2. QLineEdit - for text input
3. QTextEdit - for multi-line text
4. QComboBox - for dropdowns
5. QSpinBox - for numeric input
6. QPushButton - for actions
7. QCheckBox - for toggles
8. QListWidget, QTreeWidget, QTableWidget - for data views
9. QSlider - for ranges

### Focus Timing:
- Uses `QTimer.singleShot(50, ...)` to ensure elements are rendered before focus
- Provides smooth focus transitions without jarring jumps
- Allows screen readers time to process page changes

### Logging:
- Debug logging for all focus changes to help with troubleshooting
- Logs widget types and names when focus is set
- Helps developers understand focus flow during testing

## Benefits for Screen Reader Users:

1. **Immediate Context**: Screen readers immediately announce the most relevant content when pages change
2. **Logical Navigation**: Focus follows a logical priority order based on typical user workflows
3. **No Lost Focus**: Eliminates situations where users lose focus context during navigation
4. **Keyboard Efficiency**: Reduces need for tab navigation to find relevant controls
5. **Clear Announcements**: Proper accessible names and descriptions provide clear context

## Testing:

- Created `test_focus_management.py` for automated focus testing
- Verified focus behavior across all wizard pages
- Tested keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- Confirmed no focus is lost during page transitions

This implementation ensures that screen reader users have a smooth, accessible experience when using the EnBraille wizard interface.
